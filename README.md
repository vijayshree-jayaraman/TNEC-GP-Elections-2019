# TNEC-GP-Elections-2019 üèÜ

This project contains a tidy dataset of 2019 Tamil Nadu Gram Panchayat Elections with GP codes, LGD codes, Census 2011 regional codes and shrugid2

## Introduction

Tamil Nadu Gram Panchayat (GP) President Election data for the year 2019 was released in Tamil language. 	<br>
The data can be found here : https://tnsec.tn.nic.in/tnsec_upload/results/rlbe2019/vpp.html 	<br>
The unicode font in the pdfs are outdated, luckily I know the language! üå∏ <br>
I have extracted data from the pdfs and manually spell checked the GP names in order to match with other government datasets. <br>
The dataset consists of both location names in both tamil and english (as per the State government and Central government spellings) <br>
Candidate names and their husband's/father's name was dropped. <br>

## Usage
This data can be used to understand gram panchayats of Tamil Nadu when merged with other public good datasets available at the Village or/and Gram Panchayat level. <br>
Information on whether the GP was reserved for women / SC / ST would be particularly of use. <br>
Regional codes will help you merge with other administrative datasets seamlessly :) <br>

I would appreciate if you could cite the use of this dataset. A suggested citation would be ;

You can find a data map of the data sources utilized to clean and merge this particular dataset. <br>
The text in white circles highlights the variable that was used to merge and the white box indicates the dataset and its source. The faded region indicates the work I am yet to do.
