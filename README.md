# TNEC-GP-Elections-2019

This project contains a tidy dataset of 2019 Tamil Nadu Gram Panchayat Elections with GP codes, LGD codes, Census 2011 regional codes and shrugid2

## Introduction

Tamil Nadu Gram Panchayat (GP) President Election data for the year 2019 was released in Tamil language. 
The data can be found here : https://tnsec.tn.nic.in/tnsec_upload/results/rlbe2019/vpp.html
The unicode font in the pdfs are outdated, luckily I know the language!
I have extracted data from the pdfs and manually spell checked the GP names in order to match with other government datasets.
The dataset consists of both location names in both tamil and english (as per the State government and Central government spellings)
Candidate names and their husband's/father's name was dropped. 


## Usage
This data can be used to understand gram panchayats of Tamil Nadu when merged with other public good datasets available at the Village or/and Gram Panchayat level.
Information on whether the GP was reserved for women / SC / ST would be particularly of use.
Regional codes will help you merge with other administrative datasets seamlessly :)


## Contributing

This is my first time doing this, so let me know if anything can be improved!

## Software

The data was cleaned with a mix of softwares including R and Stata 17.
